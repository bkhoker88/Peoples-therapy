            The People’s Therapy is a virtual mental health practice of diverse
            and inclusive therapists who identify as BIPOC. Our mission is to
            provide excellent mental health services at affordable fees and via
            insurance. We are passionate about learning and therefore our
            clinicians are constantly working and growing their clinical skills
            to bring the latest tools and interventions to their therapy
            sessions. We believe everyone should have access to exceptional
            mental health care from well trained licensed clinicians, with
            someone you can identify with whether through lived experience,
            culture or race, and at your convenience.
