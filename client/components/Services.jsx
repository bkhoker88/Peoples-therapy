        <h3> Telehealth</h3>
        <li>Will my insurance cover telemental health?</li>
        <p>
          For a long time, only some insurance companies honored video visits.
          However, in the wake of COVID-19, video visits must be treated the
          same as office visits.
        </p>
        <li>Are video visits private? </li>
        <p>
          We offer video visits via several HIPAA-compliant video platforms. In
          the event that such technology is not working, you may have your
          session through another platform, such as FaceTime or Google Hangouts.
          Please know that while it is highly unlikely that anyone will try to
          hack into your therapy session, we do want to know that we cannot
          guarantee privacy. We highly suggest password-protecting your WiFi
          connection. At the start of your visit, your therapist will verify
          your current location as well as a “privacy word”. Should another
          person enter the room, you will speak the privacy word and your
          therapist will know to stop talking until you say it is okay to
          resume.
        </p>
        <li>Is a video visit similar to an office visit?</li>
        <p>
          Essentially, yes. You will be in your own home rather than in our
          offices on your therapist’s couch. Your session will otherwise take
          shape like it would in-person. Sometimes there may be technology
          problems due to so many providers now using video technology to confer
          with patients.

        <h3> Individual Psychotherapy</h3>
        <p>
          Individual psychotherapy is a way for you to learn about yourself
          including items such as diagnosis and symptoms, behavioral and
          communication patterns, thought patterns, and relational patterns. It
          can also be used to clarify one’s values and direction in life. It can
          be used for ventilation and as time to de-stress. But it can also help
          to address unresolved issues from the past in order to gain closure
          and to begin again on a new, positive path. No two people are
          alike—each person requires an individualized approach in order to
          change, grow, and heal. The role of the therapist is to act as an
          empathetic non-authoritarian guide. This is your time to discuss your
          needs. We can work on issues in your present life, we can delve into
          items from your past, or a combination of both. We can use a variety
          of techniques, such as Gestalt, REBT, CBT, psychodynamics, supportive
          counseling, and Motivational Interviewing, to name a few.
        </p>
        <li>Is individual psychotherapy covered by insurance?</li>
        <p>
          Individual psychotherapy is typically covered by insurance as long as
          the patient receives a diagnosis. This is known as medical necessity.
          However, if you have an insurance plan that comes from your employer,
          your coverage will be based on what your employer elects. Some
          employers elect behavioral health coverage with no limits, some impose
          a number of the amount of sessions you can have in a calendar year,
          and other employers choose to forgo behavioral health coverage
          altogether. Some employers may also elect to have behavioral health
          covered by an insurance plan that is completely separate from your
          health insurance. Regardless, the Refresh team will have your coverage
          verified prior to your intake appointment.

        <h3>Relationship Therapy</h3>
        <p>
          Relationship therapy is a safe space where people begin to communicate
          their needs and feelings without fear of being attacked or criticized.
          Communication includes both being listened to and being open to
          listen. In such an atmosphere, people are able to experience how old
          ways of destructive conflict can change into productive dialogue. They
          see one another as if anew. Not every couple who seeks counseling is
          in crisis. ”{' '}

        {/* <h3> Family Therrapy</h3>
        <p>
          Family therapy helps families who are experiencing relationship
          conflict and perhaps are experiencing a volatile home environment or
          families who have experienced a crisis or tragedy that is difficult to
          cope with. Family therapy provides support and perspective by
          reflecting and encouraging each participant to gain a better awareness
          about themselves as well as the feelings and needs of others within
          the family system. Family counseling will help each participant
          develop necessary insight and skills to approach relationship
          difficulties and challenges in a way that is helpful and effective.
          The ultimate goal of family counseling is to improve family
          functioning through mutual trust, communication and conflict
          resolution skills. The therapist may ask all or several family members
          to participate in the therapy process and participants play an active
          role and have input on treatment goals and who attends appointments
          during scheduled sessions. Family therapy can take place in the office
          or in your home and all family members will have input as to where the
          sessions will take place.
